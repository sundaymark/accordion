            <div class="question">How do Jehovah’s Witnesses determine whether a holiday is acceptable?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">Before deciding whether to celebrate a particular holiday,
                Jehovah’s Witnesses consult the Bible. Some holidays and celebrations clearly
                violate Bible principles. When that is the case, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not
                participate.
                Regarding other holidays, each Witness makes his or her own choice,
                striving “to maintain a clear conscience before God and men.”​—Acts 24:16.

            <div class="question">Should I Pray to Saints?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">The Bible’s answer
                No. The Bible shows that we should pray only to God, in Jesus’ name. Jesus told his
                disciples: “This is how you are to pray:
                Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.” (Matthew 6:9, New American Bible)
                Never did he instruct his disciples to pray to saints, angels, or anyone other
                than God.
                Jesus also told his followers: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
                No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6, NAB) Only Jesus
                is authorized by God to intercede on our behalf.—Hebrews 7:25.</div>

            <div class="question">Did Jesus die on a cross?</div>
            <div class="answer">WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY
                The Romans executed Jesus by hanging him on a cross made of two pieces of wood.
                WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
                Jesus was executed “by hanging on a tree.” (Acts 5:30, The New Jerusalem Bible)
                Both of the words used by Bible writers to describe the instrument of Jesus’
                death suggest one piece of wood, not two. The Greek word stau·rosʹ,
                according to Crucifixion in Antiquity, means “a pole in the broadest sense.
                It is not the equivalent of a ‘cross.’” The word xyʹlon, used at Acts 5:30,
                is “simply an upright pale or stake to which the Romans nailed those who
                were thus said to be crucified.” *
                The Bible also relates the method of Jesus’ execution
                to an ancient Israelite law. The law stipulated:
                “If a man commits a sin deserving the sentence of death and
                he has been put to death and you have hung him on a stake, . . .
                the one hung up is something accursed of God.” (Deuteronomy 21:22, 23)
                Referring to that law, the Christian apostle Paul wrote that Jesus
                became “a curse instead of us, because it is written:
                ‘Accursed is every man hung upon a stake [xyʹlon].’” (Galatians 3:13)
                Paul thus indicated that Jesus died on a stake—a single piece of wood.
                “They killed him by hanging him on a tree.”—Acts 10:39, The New</div>
